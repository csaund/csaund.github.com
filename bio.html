				<p class="info">As you can see, this is a lovely photo of me</p>
				<p class="info">Carolyn was born and raised in San Carlos, California. She grew up with her older brother, Bradley, and mother and father, <br>
				who both graduated from MIT. In high school she developed an interest in neuroscience, which she purused dilligently both academically <br>
				as well as in her spare time. She followed that interest to Tufts University, where she took her first computer science course <br>
				almost by a stroke of luck, and never looked back. She now studies both Cognitive Sciences and Computer Science at Tufts, and <br>
				plans to study abroad at University of Auckland in New Zealand next fall. </p>
				<p class="info">In her free time, Carolyn enjoys doing anything outside, including (but not limited to):
					<ul><li>Rock Climbing</li>
					<li>Backpacking</li>
					<li>Camping</li>
					<li>Mountineering</li>
					<li>Ice Climbing</li>
					</ul></p>
					<p class="info">She dedicates much of her free time to the Leaders' Council of her sorority, Alpha Omicron Pi, where she plays a large role in <br>
					the academic development of the chapter. She takes her passion for the advancement of women in STEM fields with her to local schools, <br>
					where she teaches robotics to young girls and is in the process of developing a Computer Science badge for the Girl Scouts Association <br>
					of America.
