hello future Carolyn

bet you're pretty frustrated at how much latex fuckin' sucks, aren't you. 

Well, if you're using TexShop, in order to edit files and get them to compile, use:
- LuaLaTex typesetting engine in TexShop 
AND
- move all of the files you want to edit up one directory (to ~/github/csaund.github.com/resume) and make sure to only edit from here. 
  -- you need to do this because csaund_resume-openfont.cls is in this directory AND
  -- the /fonts directory is set from here. 

godspeed.
