			<b>About Me</b> <br>
				I will receive my B.S. in Computer Science and Cognitive
				and Brain Sciences from Tufts University in May 2015. My main focus in both areas of study has primarily been <b>Machine Learning</b> and <b>Artificial Intelligence</b>, which I intend to continue in graduate studies. <br>
				I am motivated by passion. Whatever the task, being surrounded by passionate people brings out my most inspired and creative work. I love working in teams small enough to personally interact with each member every day, and take as easily to leading a project I care about as I do to following a team lead's vision.<br>
				I have also been described as an avid world traveller. For more about who I am and how I fill my time, check out what I <b>do</b> and <b>where</b> I've been up above.  
		</p>
		<p class="my who" id="me-intro">
			<b>Professional Goals</b><br>
			I am searching for a company that speaks to my ideal increase-awesome, decrease-suck world balance. Which is to say, I want to work somewhere that cares about its <b>global positive impact</b>. Whether it's tools that enable others to be more effective, or a direct channel for charitable influence, I care deeply about improving the world around me.<br>
			I hope to attend a PhD program in Machine Learning within the next 5 years.

		<b>Coming soon:</b> pictures of rock climbing in Vietnam, ice climbing in New Hampshire, those damn half-marathons I keep signing up for, my latest sea kayak adventure, and that one time I tried to bike 134 miles on a hybrid bike with no training. 
		</p>

		<p class="my make">
		Many of my projects are located on my <a href="http://github.com/csaund">github</a>.
		</p>
		<p class="my make">
		I want a nice place to display code samples, so currently I'm trying to figure out how that's going
		to work. Some cool projects I've made that I'd love to talk about are
		</p>
		<p class="my make">
			<ul class="my make">
				<li>Building a (simple) Probabilistic Model of Cognition in church</li>
				<li>Type inference implemented in ML</li>
				<li>Learning Go by making a Go AI</li>
				<li>This web page which taught me oh so much about frontend dev. Please help me.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p class="my make">
			<b>Current Side Projects</b>
				Presently, I am working on building my first mobile apps (android) which are "ReaList," a
				list-keeping app that actually does all the things you want it to do, and "FuxWit" -- think
				Reddit meets YikYak/Twitter for location-based information sharing. On both projects I design UI and do front-end development. <br>
				I am also in the middle of writing a Go AI. My plan for that is to use Theano's ML library to train a neural net on Go game states and use a reinforcement learning algorithm to determine ideal game states. Last time I did this (with <a href="https://github.com/csaund/deep-pink.git">Chess</a>) it was really slow, so we'll see if it gets any better.

			<b>Code Samples</b>
			<p class="my make code-style">
			Well this would be a great place for a code sample 
			if only I could figure out how to do auto styling in CSS.

			Find some of my more expressive moments here.
			Stay tuned for my TEDx video!

		Many of great things I've seen, read, or otherwise intellectually ingested that I think everyone should take part in. Some are harder to digest than others.
