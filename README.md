Much inspiration for the design of this resume was gleaned from
the good people at google who create resume templates, as well as
the honorable Eric Weinstein of Codeacademy who has stuck with me
through thick and thin teaching me CSS. 
I believe all aspects of the assignment are implemented correctly. 
Including the time on codeacademy to learn html and CSS, this assignment
took about 6-7 hours.
